# IFSOD-dataset
Dataset approched by A Benchmark and Frequency Compression Method for Infrared Few-Shot Object Detection

This dataset aims to provide an open evaluation scheme for small sample object detection tasks. It aims to enrich the training categories and sample pose changes. Contains over 4800 images, over 23000 instances, covering 8 scenes and 18 coarse-grained categories. We have established three random partitions for categories. Each partition contains base classes and new class images that comply with the few sample setting.
